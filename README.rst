Michael Gallaspy
================

I am software engineer with a B.S. degree in physics and mathematics. My
specialties are embedded applications, web applications (front- and
back-end), and scientific computing. My professional experiences
include:

-  Extending a large Django project. Deep dives into Django internals to
   solve a variety of problems.

-  Data analysis with Python, including use of numpy, pandas,
   matplotlib, scikit-learn, and jupyter.

-  Distributing Python packages, specifically with setuptools and
   publishing packages to PyPI.

-  Working with two Javascript front-end frameworks, Backbone.js and
   vue.js.

-  Building graphical UIs in the browser and for native applications
   with Qt & C++.

-  Using SQLite, postgres, and MySQL, including writing schemas and
   nontrivial queries.

-  Using continuous integration services like Bamboo, Jenkins, and
   CircleCI.

-  Integration testing with Selenium, both in the browser and on native
   apps using Qt bindings.

-  Familiarity with Agile/Scrum.

-  Experience with Linux, including shell scripting and command-line
   expertise.

I bring value beyond merely fulfilling a position to the companies I
work for. Whatever I am working on, I feverishly seek to improve as an
individual contributor, and to explore best practices for my team in
order to efficiently deliver the most value to customers. In past
positions I have gone beyond my normal duties in the following ways:

-  I gathered detailed timing information about the compilation of a
   large C++ project and performed a basic cluster analysis. As a result
   I identified bottlenecks during compilation, and recommend targeted
   changes which would decrease compile times an estimated 7%, saving
   about 20 man-hours per month for that project.

-  I proposed an implementation of a framework for detecting distracted
   driving using the data available from smartphones and embedded
   on-board devices in automobiles, including detailed recommendations
   such as data collection methods and sampling rates for calculations
   to yield minimal error propagation.

-  While teaching high school in rural Liberia for the Peace Corps, I
   organized a teacher-training workshop for my school district, a
   multi-district math competition, and co-organized a nation-wide chess
   competition for students.

Cool and/or fun things I have done
==================================

Here are some open-source projects that I have either solely authored or
contributed significantly to:

-  An intro to C++ template metaprogramming I wrote:
   `Dr. Strangetemplate <https://github.com/MCGallaspy/dr_strangetemplate>`__

-  An open source project for use in classrooms in developing countries
   (major contributor):
   `ka-lite <https://github.com/learningequality/ka-lite>`__

A sorted, incomplete list of languages/libraries/stuff I know & math topics I like
==================================================================================

C, C++, C++ template metaprogramming, complexity theory, data
structures, design patterns, differential geometry, Django, functional
analysis, git, HTML+CSS, javascript, linear algebra, multithreaded
programming, NumPy, open-source contribution, probability & statistics,
Python, Qt, remote working (it is a skillset!), SymPy, and writing good
documentation (actually I just like writing in general).

Education
=========

**B.S. in mathematics and physics** - University of Nevada, Reno. 2010.
